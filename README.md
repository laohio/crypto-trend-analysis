Title: Cryptocurrency Trend Analysis <br>
Author: Nicholas A. Ficeto <br>

Description: <br>
I made this Jupyter Notebook to learn more about popular technical indicators in the stock world, and how they can apply to cryptocurrencies. This notebook was purely made for fun and learning purposes; whether technical indicators like bollinger bands are actually useful applied to cryptocurrencies remains a subject of debate. Currently, I've added bollinger bands, but I'd like to add other features/indicators (RSI, MACD).
